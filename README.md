This project comprises with GUI Component execution and CMD execution with decorators.\
In the project we used 'MYSQL', [tkcalander](https://pypi.org/project/tkcalendar/), [mysql.connector](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/), [prettytable](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/).\
You can find the required packages in `requirements.txt`.
## Create Database and Table

Create SQL DB and Table in SQL Client itself.\
DB Name: studs.\
Table Name: record.\
You can find queries in the `db.sql` file

### CODE V1 - Run Curd.py

Find the `curd.py` in Code V1 project and run it.

### CODE V2 - pip install requirements.txt
